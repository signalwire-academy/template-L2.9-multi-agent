    Excellent work! You've completed Lab 2.9: Multi-Agent Architecture.

    You've learned how to:
    - Create multiple specialized agents
    - Register agents with AgentServer
    - Route between agents using swml_transfer()
    - Give each agent unique functions

    **Next steps:**
    - Continue to Lab 2.10: Production Deployment

  fail: |
    Some checks didn't pass. Review the requirements and try again.

    **Tips:**
    - Define each agent class (GeneralAgent, SalesAgent, SupportAgent)
    - Each agent needs route parameter in __init__
    - Use AgentServer to register all agents
    - Run `swaig-test solution/agent.py --agent-class GeneralAgent --list-tools`
    - Run `swaig-test solution/agent.py --agent-class SalesAgent --list-tools`
    - Run `swaig-test solution/agent.py --agent-class SupportAgent --list-tools`
